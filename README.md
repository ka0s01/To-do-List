# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.


---

## Why I Made This

- To understand how CRUD applications work  
- To practice using JavaScript to control application behavior  
- To learn how state, rendering, and events work together  
- To move away from inline JavaScript and messy DOM manipulation  

---

## What I Learned

- How to maintain a state
- How CRUD maps to frontend actions:
  - Create → Add task  
  - Read → Display tasks  
  - Update → Mark a task as completed
  - Delete → Remove task  
- How to render UI from state instead of manually changint the DOM
- Event listeners vs inline event handlers
- Event delegation for dynamic elements
- How to structure code into:
  - state
  - render functions
  - event handlers
  - actions
- How localStorage works for persistence

## Future Improvements
